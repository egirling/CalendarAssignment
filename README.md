Things to know about our calendar:
  When you edit an event that doesnâ€™t exist, it creates a new event with the corresponding input values. 
  One of the users we created has a username of user1 and a password of user1 that you can log in with. 
  You may also create your own users.
  All the functions of the calendar are below it, if for some reason it looks like a change has not updated on the calendar (event doesn't appear after
  creation) you may click the update button located right underneath the calendar.
